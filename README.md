# tic-tac-toe-Game
This code was written using python.

 This code implements the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The minimax function recursively evaluates possible moves by simulating the game up to a certain depth, considering both maximizing (X player) and minimizing (O player) players. Alpha-beta pruning is applied to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the minimax tree, improving the algorithm's efficiency.

In the minimax function, alpha represents the best score that the maximizing player (X) can achieve so far at any choice point along the path, and beta represents the best score that the minimizing player (O) can achieve. The algorithm updates these alpha and beta values as it explores the game tree, and it prunes branches that are guaranteed to be worse than the best alternative discovered so far.

Overall, the code implements a simple tic-tac-toe game where the computer (X player) plays optimally using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine its moves.
